# rTemp Examples

This directory contains example applications and integrations of the rTemp water temperature model.

## Available Examples

### GoldSim Integration

**Directory:** `goldsim_integration/`

A complete example of integrating rTemp into GoldSim dynamic simulation software using the GSPy Python bridge.

**Features:**
- Stateless physics engine architecture
- Daily to hourly temporal disaggregation
- Automatic dewpoint estimation
- State management via feedback loops
- Complete documentation and setup scripts

**Use Cases:**
- Water resource management models
- TMDL (Total Maximum Daily Load) studies
- Climate change impact assessment
- Probabilistic water temperature modeling

**Documentation:**
- [Integration Guide](goldsim_integration/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- [Quick Reference](goldsim_integration/QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
- [Troubleshooting](goldsim_integration/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

## Future Examples

Additional examples may include:
- Standalone Python scripts for common scenarios
- Integration with other modeling platforms
- Calibration and validation workflows
- Sensitivity analysis examples
- Long-term climate scenario analysis
